# A circular queue is a collection of objects stored 
# in a buffer that is treated as though it is connected 
# end-to-end in a circle. When an object is added to this circular queue, 
# it is added to the position that immediately follows the most recently added object, 
# while removing an object always removes the object that has been in the queue the longest.

# This works as long as there are empty spots in the buffer. 
# If the buffer becomes full, adding a new object to the queue 
# requires getting rid of an existing object; with a circular queue, 
# the object that has been in the queue the longest is discarded and replaced by the new object.

# Assuming we have a circular queue with room for 3 objects, 
# the circular queue looks and acts like this:

# Your task is to write a CircularQueue class that implements a circular queue 
# for arbitrary objects. The class should obtain the buffer size with an argument 
# provided to CircularQueue::new, and should provide the following methods:

# enqueue to add an object to the queue
# dequeue to remove (and return) the oldest object in the queue. 
# It should return nil if the queue is empty.

# You may assume that none of the values stored in the queue are nil 
# (however, nil may be used to designate empty spots in the buffer).
