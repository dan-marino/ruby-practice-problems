a = [5, 9, 3, 11]
puts a.min(1)

sometimes if you can't find something, 
it might be because of multiple inheritance 
which means that a class will inherit methods from other superclasses. 
and documentation for that will be in those superclasses. 
that's why i like that method search option in the OG doc
